<P>I remember it was one day in the past;<br>
It was the beauty morning with the sunrise;<br>
My dad was already left home for his job;<br>
My mom was on the door calling me;<br>
I don’t know what happened but our house was down in a short.<br>
My mom commanded me “KAMANZI run quicker, never come back no matter what”<br>
She then died and I remember<br>
The God’s miracle happened, I survived.<br>
</p>
<p style="color:blue">I remember, I found myself sat on the road crying;
Maybe I taught that mom would come and fetch me as usual;
Maybe I taught that my dad would pass by and see me;
I remember seeing people run, some of them were casualties; (ibimuga)
I remember seeing dead people but I taught they were sleeping;
I remember a black big man coming to me;
He sat in front me, he asked about mom and dad;
He told me Kana Gato don’t trust anybody;
He then went, I remember he left me under the sugar cane trees;
The God’s miracle happened, I survived.
</p>

<p style="font-family:courier">I remember, from that moment the cross life started;
I don’t know when I fall asleep but I waked up in the middle of the next day crying;
In a while calling my mom, I saw a group of people passing;
Then I followed them, they were running speedily;
A man behind me carried me on his back, I was running slowly while the killer was faster;
I remember we went to the church where me and mom used to attend Mess during Sunday;
I remember my school was nearby;
I remember a nun(Massera) who used to feed me during those days of hiding;
I remember when I asked the man when my mom and dad would comeback for me;
The man told me that he brought me there in order to survive;
The nun told me that mom and dad will come back one day;
She then said to me “please dear now see me as your mom and wait for their return”.
